<h1> History of Surfing</h1>

<h2>Background of Surfing</h2>
<p>Surfing began when the first Chinese immigrants tried to come to Hawaii but didn't want to pay the fee to board the boats. They repurposed their Chinese take-out food containers and used glue and duct tape to hold them together, creating the first surfboards. The first issue they encountered was generating a wave big enough to send them all the way to Hawaii. For this, they solved by using your mom.</p>
